Keyboard Controls:
Mouse Scroll Wheel - to zoom in and out
Left Mouse Button - press and hold to drag the solar system around to 
	re-position the spherical camera, release to stop where you are.

R - reset the scene back to it's start state

Program Specifics:
This program was built on a Ubuntu 18.04 Linux distribution. The program was
developed in the eclipse environment built off of the supplied boiler plate 
for Linux Eclipse. To compile my program I used the default g++
compiler (I assume is g++). To compile I ran the build directly through 
Eclipse.

I obtained my textures from https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/
and borrowed inspiration for my shading model from reading the textbook,
chapter 17.
